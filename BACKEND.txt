 NODE & EXPRESS
-----------------

MVC Archietecture
-----------------
-> MVC is basically used for create a fullstack project / Application
    M -> Model - represent the structure in which the data is stored.
    V -> View - user interface - where the user interact with application.
    C -> Controller - use to set the logic to resolve the request.

    Routing - To set the path to resolve the request. (To chanalize the request coming to the server side.)

    DataBase - Where the data is stored.

NODE
----
-> Not a programming Language
-> It provides a environment to run the JavaScript outside the browser.
-> V8 JavaScript Engine - Google
-> JavaScript Libraries.
-> Extention .js

Instalation
-----------
Features-> single tread

Node Modules
------------

-> Node modules are files / JavaScript Libearies than can be used in node.js applications to provide certain functionalities.
-> If we want to include modeule, we need to import that molule.
-> require() - used to import modules.
-> module.export - to export the module.

Type of Modules
---------------
1) Custome Modules.
2) Builtin Modules.
    1> File system modules
    ----------------------
    -> Allows to work with the files inside your system.
    Operactions
    ------------
        1) read file - readFile()
        2) write file - writeFile()
        3) update - writeFile()
        4) Delete file - unlink()
        5) Rename file - rename()

    utf8 - unicode transformation formate -8bit // encode

    2> Http module
    --------------
    -> used to create http server that can listen to a server port and gives a response back to a client.
    -> handles http request

    -> on() -  to create events
    -> emit() - to invoke the event

Environment Variables
---------------------
-> predefined values that are typically used to provide  the ablity to configure a value in your code from outside the application.

EXPRESS
--------
-> Node.js framework
    Steps to create / setup a server using EXPRESS
        1) create a folder for server
        2) create package.json - npm init -y
        3) install  packages - Express, dotenv, cors, mongoose
            Express - npm i express
            dotenv - npm i dotenv 
            cors - npm i cors
            mongoose - npm i mongoose

            npm i express dotenv cors mongoose
        4) Add file .gitignore


    cors - cross orgin resource sharing
    -----------------------------------
    -> to connect frontend with the server to enable communication

    dotenv
    -------
    -> to load environment variables 
    -> loads .env file contents into process.env by default
    -> config()

mongoose
---------
=> to connect server with DataBase
=> connect()

-------------------------------------------------------
                    MiddleWare
-------------------------------------------------------
    -> its a function which have the ablity to break req-res cycle.
    -> appart from another function middleware mush have three arguments.
    1arg -> request
    2arg -> response
    3arg -> next

    -> There are 2types of middleware
        1> Application specific middleware
            -> all the request in the application must pass through the middleware
        2> router specific middleware
            -> will be only active in a particular route / path

            iat - time at which token is generated (issued at)

            multer
            ---------
